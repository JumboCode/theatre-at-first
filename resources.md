## Installing Node and `npm`
- We are going to use NVM (node version manager) to deal with node installations. You
can get it [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
    - after you have run the install script, run `nvm install node` to install the latest
    version of node.
- To manage node packages, we will be using `pnpm`, which you can install by running `npm
i -g pnpm`. `i` is short for install, and the `-g` flag installs it globally rather than
on a per-project basis.
